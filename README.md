# Tiny-Whoop
The Tiny Whoop is a compact indoor drone built with a 3D-printed frame, brushed motors, propellers, an AIO flight controller, and radio control. It teaches 3D design, soldering, electronics, and flight control, offering a safe, educational, and rewarding hands-on project.


This CLI output represents the “code” configuration of the flight controller and can be restored at any time.
